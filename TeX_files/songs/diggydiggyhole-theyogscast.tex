	[Em]Brothers of the mine rejoice! [C]Swing, [G]swing, [Em]swing with me.
	[Em]Raise your pick and raise your voice! [C]Sing, [G]sing, [Em]sing with me.
	[Em]Down and down in[D]to the deep. [C]Who knows what we'll [G]find beneath?
	[Em]Diamonds, rubies, [D]gold and more, [B]hidden in the mountain store.

		\songsection{Pre-Chorus}
		[C]Born under[G]ground, [D]suckled from a teat of stone.
		[C]Raised in the [G]dark, the [D]safety of our mountain home.
		[C]Skin made of [G]iron, [B]steel in our [C]bones.
		To [C]dig and dig makes us free. [D]Come on, brothers, sing with me!

		\songsection{Chorus}
		[Em]I am a [G]dwarf and I'm [D]digging a [C]hole.
		[C]Diggy diggy [G]hole, [C]diggy diggy [B]hole.
		[Em]I am a [G]dwarf and I'm [D]digging a [C]hole.
		[C]Diggy diggy [G]hole, [B]digging a [Em]hole.

	The sunlight will not reach this low - deep, deep in the mine.
	Never seen the blue moon glow - dwarves won't fly so high.
	Fill a glass and down some meat. Stuff your bellies at the feast.
	Stumble home and fall asleep, dreaming in our mountain keep.
	
	\begin{slimhighlightbar}
		\songsection{Pre-Chorus}
		Born underground, grown inside a rocky womb
		The earth is our cradle; the mountain shall become out tomb
		Face us on the battlefield; you will meet your doom
		We do not fear what lies beneath. We can never dig too deep

	[Bm]Hey hey hey![G ] [D ] [F#]{}
	
	\songsection{Verse 1}
	[Bm] When I first set myself [G]on the road
	[D] I was stunned by [A]sights untold.
	[Bm] By the sea and a[G]cross the lands,
	[D] With a calming [F#]drink in hand.
	
	Italian way, grappa grappa hey,
	Deutschland Lager Ã¼ber alles,
	If Aquavit left me feeling bleak,
	A pint of bitter will make it cheers.

		\songsection{Chorus (x2)}
		Hey hey hey! I'm a man with a plan.
		The plan is to booze as much as I can.
		Hey hey hey! I will be this way
		Until the fall of my final day.

	\songsection{Verse 2}
	Spirits are high tonight,
	Mostly of the bottled kind.
	Our clan is gathered here.
	And the plan is loud and clear.
	
	Everyone in full swing
	Brothers of kin will attempt to sing.
	No one cares what tomorrow brings
	And the sauna burns down again.

	\small \songsection{Intro}
	[Bb]Life is like an ocean voyage and our [F]bodies are the ships
	And with[C]out a moral compass we would [A]all be cast a[Dm]drift[\optionalChord{Dm/C}]{}
	So to [Bb]keep us on our bearings, the [F]Lord gave us a gift
	And [C]like most gifts you get, it was a [C7]book
	
	\songsection{Verse 1}
	I [F]only read one book, but it's a [Bb]good book, don't you know
	I [C]act the way I act because the [Bb]Good Book tells me [F]so
	If I [F]wanna known how [F7]to be good, it's [Bb]to the Good Book [Bbm]that I go
	'Cos the [C]Good Book is a book and it is [Bb]good and it's a [F]book
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	I know the Good Book's good because the Good Book says it's good
	I know the Good Book knows it's good because a really good book would
	You wouldn't cook without a cookbook and I think it's understood
	You can't be good without a Good Book 'cos it's good and it's a book
	And it is [F]good for cookin'[\optionalChord{Fmaj}]{}
	
	\songsection{Bridge 1}
	I [Dm]tried to read some other books, but I [A]soon gave up on that.
	The [Bb]paragraphs ain't numbered and they [F]complicate the [C]facts
	I [A]can't read Harry Potter 'cos they're [Dm]worshipping false gods and that
	And [G]Dumbledore's a poofter and that's [C]bad, 'cos it's not good.
	
	\songsection{Verse 3}
	Morality is written there in simple white and black
	I feel sorry for you heathens, got to think about all that
	Good is good and evil's bad and goats are good and pigs are crap
	You'll find which one is which in the Good Book, 'cos it's good
	And it's a book, and it's a book (yeah)
	
	\songsection{Bridge 2}
	I had a cat, she gave birth to a litter
	The kittens were adorable and they made my family laugh
	But as they grew they started misbehavin'
	So I drowned the little fuckers in the bath
	When the [A]creatures in your care start being [Dm]menaces
	The [G]answers can be found right there in [C]Genesis!
	Chapter [D]6, Verse 5-7! (yee-haw!)
	
	\songsection{Interlude 1}
	[G]Swing your partner by the hand, [C]have a baby if you can
	But [D]if the voices your head [D7]say to sacri[G]fice your kid
	To [G]satiate your [G7]loving God's [C]fetish for dead [Cm]baby blood
	It's [D]simple fate, the Book demands, so raise that knife up in your hand!
	
	\songsection{Verse 4}
	Before the Good Book made us good, there was no good way to know
	If a thing was good or not that good or kind of touch and go
	So God decided he'd give writing allegoric prose a go
	And so he wrote a book and it was generally well-received
	
	\songsection{Reviews}
	The [Bb]Telegraph said, "This God is remi[F]niscent of the [C]Norse."
	The [Bb]Times said, "Kind of turgid, but I [F]liked the bit with [C]horses."
	The [A]Mail said, "Lots of massacres, a [Dm]violent tour de force.
	If you [G]only read one book this year, then [C]this one is a book
	And it is [D]good, and it's a book!" (yeehaw)
	
	\songsection{Interlude 2}
	Swing your daughter by the hand but if she gets raped by a man
	And refuses then to marry him, stone her to death!
	
	\songsection{Pre-Outro}
	[Em] If you just close your eyes and block your [B]ears
	To the ac[C]cumulated knowledge of the [G]last two thousand [D]years
	Then [B]morally, guess what? You're off the [Em]hook
	And thank [A]Christ you only have to read one [D]book
	\pagebreak
	\songsection{Outro}
	[Dm]Just because the book's contents were [A]written generations hence
	By hairy desert-dwelling gents, squatting in their dusty tents
	[Em]Just because what Heaven said was [B]said before they'd leavened bread
	Just 'cos Jesus couldn't read, doesn't mean that we should need
	When ma[C]nipulating human genes to al[G]leviate pain and fight disease
	When deciding whether it's wrong or right to help the dyin' let go of life
	Or [D]stop a pregnancy when it's [D7]just a tiny blastocyst
	There's [B]no reason why [\optionalChord{B7}]we should take a [Em]look at [D]any other [C]book 
	But the [Bm7]Good Book 'cause it's [A]good and it's a book 
	And it's a [D]book and it's quite good!
	
	[G]Good is good and [G7]evil's bad and [C/E]kids get killed when [Cm/E]God gets mad
	And you'd [D]better take a good look at the [C7]Good Book [G]{}

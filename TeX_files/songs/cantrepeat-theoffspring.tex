	\songsection{Verse 1}
	[A ] I woke the other day [C] and saw my world has changed
	[F ] The past is over, but to[G]morrow's wishful thinkin'
	[A ] Can't hold onto what's been done, [C ] can't grab onto what's to come
	[F ] And I'm just wishing I could [G]stop, but
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	Life goes on, come of age
	Can't hold on, turn the page
	Time rolls on, wipe these eyes
	Yesterday laughs, tomorrow cries
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	Memories are bittersweet, (the) good times we can't repeat
	Those days are gone and we can never get 'em back
	Now we must move ahead, despite our fear and dread
	We're all just wishing we could stop, but
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	Life goes on, come of age
	Can't hold on, turn the page
	Time rolls on, wipe your eyes
	Yesterday laughs, tomorrow cries

	\songsection{Bridge}
	With all our joys and fears, wrapped in forgotten years
	The past is laughing as today just slips away
	Time tears down what we've made and sets another stage
	And I'm just wishing we could [G]stop [\textit{N.C.}]{}
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	[A]Life [G]goes [A]on, come of [C]age
	Can't hold on, turn the page
	Time rolls on, wipe these eyes
	Yesterday laughs, tomorrow cries
	
	\songsection{Outro}
	Time rolls [A]oh-oh-[C]oh-oh-[F]on [G A]{}\hfill\end{guitar}

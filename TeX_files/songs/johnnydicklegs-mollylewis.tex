	\songsection{Verse 1}
	Since the [F#m]sun came up this morning there's a [A]rumor going round
	That [D]there's a brand new sheriff who just [A]hobbled into [C#7]town.
	He's not an [F#m]outlaw or a villain, but his [A]reputation sticks
	Because [C#7]where his thighs \& calves should go, he's got a pair of [F#m]dicks.
	
	\begin{highlightbar}
		\songsection{Refrain}
		Because he's [D]Johnny! Johnny [A]Dicklegs.
		You won't [C#7]like him when he's angry, you won't [F#m]like him when he's cold.
		Because he's [D]Johnny! Johnny [A]Dicklegs.
		And he's [C#7]come to steal your woman and to pan for all your [F#m]gold. [C#7 F#m]{}
	\end{highlightbar}
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	Takes a while to put his chaps on, well into the afternoon
	So we all just play it cool when he flops into the saloon
	But it just takes a pretty gal to put some spring into his walk
	(And I'm not talking figurative... His legs are giant cocks)
	
	\begin{highlightbar}
		\songsection{Refrain}
		Because he's Johnny! Johnny Dicklegs.
		You'll have to give him just a minute, he is not quite at his best
		Because he's Johnny! Johnny Dicklegs.
		And he'll rub out all the ne'er-do-wells and ride into the west.
	\end{highlightbar}
	
	\songsection{Outro}
	([F#m]Johnny... Johnny... Johnny)
	[C#7]He's got dicks for [F#m]legs.

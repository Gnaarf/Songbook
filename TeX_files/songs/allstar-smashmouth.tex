	\songsection{Verse 1}
	Some[G]body once [D]told me 
	The [Am]world is gonna [C]roll me.
	I ain't the sharpest tool
	In the shed.
	She was looking kinda dumb 
	With her finger and her thumb
	In the shape of an "L" 
	On her forehead.
	
	Well, the years start coming and the don't stop coming. 
	Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running.
	Didn't make sense not to live for fun. 
	Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb.
	So much to do, so much to see,
	So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
	You'll never know if you don't go, 
	You'll never shine if you don't glow.
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	[G]Hey now, you're an [C]All Star, get your [C#dim]game on, [C]go play.
	[G]Hey now, you're a [C]Rock Star, get the [C#dim]show on, [C]get paid.
	And [G]all that [C]glitters is [C#dim]gold.
	[C]Only shooting [G]stars [F]break the [C]mold.
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	It's a cool place and they say it gets colder,
	You're bundled up now (but) wait till you get older.
	But the meteor men beg to differ, 
	Judging by the hole in the satellite picture.
	The ice we skate is getting pretty thin, 
	The water's getting warm so you might as well swim.
	My world's on fire. How about yours? 
	That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored.

	\songsection{Verse 3}
	Somebody once asked 
	Could I spare some change for gas.
	I need to get myself away
	From this place.
	I said "yep", what a concept, 
	I could use a little fuel myself
	And we could all use a little change.
	
	Well, the years start coming and the don't stop coming. 
	Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running.
	Didn't make sense not to live for fun. 
	Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb.
	So much to do, so much to see,
	So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
	You'll never know if you don't go, 
	You'll never shine if you don't glow.

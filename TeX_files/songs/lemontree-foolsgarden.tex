	\songsection{Verse 1}
	I'm [Em]sitting here in the [Bm]boring room.
	It's [Em]just another rainy Sunday [Bm]afternoon.
	I'm [Em]wasting my time, I got [Bm]nothing to do,
	I'm [Em]hanging around, I'm [Bm]waiting for you [Bbm]but 
	[Am]Nothing ever happens[Bm] and I [Em]wonder.[Bm Em]{}
	
	I'm driving around in my car.
	I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far.
	I'd like to change my point of view.
	I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you but
	Nothing ever happens and I wonder.
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	I [G]wonder how, I [D]wonder why. 
	[Em]Yesterday you told me 'bout the [Bm]blue, blue sky.
	And [C/G]all that I can s[D]ee is just a yellow [G]lemon tree.[D7]{}
	I'm [G]turning my head [D]up and down.
	I'm [Em]turning, turning, turning, turning, [Bm]turning around.
	And [C/G]all that I can [A7]see is just another [D7]lemon tree.
	
	\songsection{Post Chorus}
	Sing: [Em]dab,[Bm] da da da da dabn [Em]di dab daaa,[Bm] da da da da [Bbm]dabn
	 [Am]Di dab daaa,[Bm] dab dibn di daa[Em|]o[Bm Em]{}
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	I'm sitting here. I miss the power.
	I'd like to go out. Taking a shower.
	But there's a heavy cloud inside my head.
	I feel so tired, put myself into bed while
	Nothing ever happens and I wonder.
	
	\songsection{Bridge}
	[Bm] Isolation - [Em]is not good for me.
	[D] Isolation - [G]I don't want to [B]sit on the lemon tree.
	
	\songsection{Verse 3}
	I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy.
	Maybe anyhow I'll get another toy and
	Everything will happen and you wonder.
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	I wonder how, I wonder why. 
	Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
	And all that I can see is just another lemon tree.
	I'm turning my head up and down.
	I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around.
	And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree. And I wonder, wonder...
	
	\songsection{Outro}
	I [G]wonder how, I [D]wonder why. 
	[Em]Yesterday you told me 'bout the [Bm]blue, blue sky
	And [C/G]all that I can s[D]ee ... (dip dip)
	And [C/G]all that I can s[D]ee ... (dip dip)
	And [C]all that I can [D7]see is just a yellow [G]lemon tree.

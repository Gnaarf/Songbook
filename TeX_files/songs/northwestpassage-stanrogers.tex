	\songsection{Chorus}
	Ah, for [D]just one [A]time I would [G]take the Northwest [Bm]Passage
	To [G]find the hand of [D]Franklin, reaching [Em]for the Beaufort [G]Sea
	Tracing [D]one warm [A]line through a [G]land so wild and [Bm]savage
	And [G]make a Northwest [D]Passage [A]to the [D]sea
	
	\songsection{Verse 1}
	[D]Westward from the [A]Davis Strait, 'tis [G]there 'twas said to [Bm]lie
	The [G]sea route to the [D]Orient for [Em]which so many [G]died
	[D]Seeking gold and [A]glory, leaving [G]weathered, broken [Bm]bones
	And a [G]long-forgotten [D]lonely [A]cairn of [D]stones
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{Ah, for just one time...}
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	Three centuries thereafter I take passage overland
	In the footsteps of brave Kelso, where his "sea of flowers" began
	Watching cities rise before me, then behind me sink again
	This tardiest explorer driving hard across the plain
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{Ah, for just one time...}
	
	\songsection{Verse 3}
	And through the night, behind the wheel, the mileage clicking west
	I think upon Mackenzie, David Thompson and the rest
	Who cracked the mountain ramparts and did show a path for me
	To race the roaring Fraser to the sea
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{Ah, for just one time...}
	
	\songsection{Verse 4}
	How then am I so different from the first men through this way?
	Like them, I left a settled life. I threw it all away
	To seek a Northwest Passage at the call of many men
	To find there but the road back home again
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{Ah, for just one time...}

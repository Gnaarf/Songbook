	\songsection{Verse 1}
	[C] My neighbors ask me why I'm [Am]limping down the way
	[C] And who that fellow was who [Am]came by yesterday
	[F] I quickly turn my face be[C]fore I start to blush
	Cause [G]frankly there is nothing I can say
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	I've always had a thing for pushing the extremes
	And I've just got a thing you won't find in the magazines
	This molded silicone has got me begging please
	Give me more of what I really need
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	Cause there is [F]no cock like [C]horse cock. [G]Send your asshole [Am]into shock
	You need [F]horse cock. Of [C]course-cock. [G]Grab the lube and slam the day away
	
	\songsection{Verse 3}
	My shaft is quivering, my balls are turning blue as
	I think of drinking in a foot or even two of
	My favorite stallion that I keep in my top drawer
	Slip it in and I'll be dripping goo
	
	\songsection{Chorus (dampened)}
	As I take more cock, horse cock. Shut the door and turn the lock
	Is your cock a horse cock? You will never hear me saying neigh
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	Cause there is no cock like horse cock. Rub my dick inside a sock
	Don't stop now, horse cock. Stretch out my insides and make me bray
	
	\songsection{Chorus (repeat \& fade out)}
	My lovely horse cock, horse cock (scatting)
	Horse cock, horse cock (scatting)

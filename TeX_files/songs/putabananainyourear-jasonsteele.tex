	\songsection{Verse}
	[C]Charlie, you [G]look quite down with your [Am]big fat eyes and your [G]big fat frown
	[C]The world doesn't [G]have to be so [C]gray
	[C]Charlie when your [G]life's a mess, when your [Am]feeling blue or are [G]in distress
	I [C]know what can [G]wash that sad [C]away
	
	\songsection{Bridge {\footnotesize(I guess?)}}
	[G7]All you have to do is...
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	[C]Put a banana in your ear (a banana in my ear?)
	Put a ripe banana right in[G]to your favorite ear
	It's [C]true (says who?), so true. Once it's in your gloom will disappear
	The bad in the world is hard to hear when [G]in your ear a banana cheers
	So [F]go and put a ba[G]nana in your [C]ear
	
	\songsection{Chorus 2}
	[C#]Put a banana in your ear (I'd rather keep my ear clear)
	You will never be happy if you [G#]live your life in fear
	It's [C#]true! (says you) So true! When it's in the skies are bright and clear
	Oh, every day of every year the [G#]sun shines bright in this big blue sphere
	So [F#]go and put a ba[G#]nana in your
	[C#]Eeee[E]eeee[D#]eeee[D]eeee[C#]eeeaarr

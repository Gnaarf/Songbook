	\songsection{Chorus}
	This is the [Csus2]story of a girl[G5]{}
	Who cried a river and [A7sus4]drowned the whole world[D]{}
	And while she [Bm]looks so sad in [Csus2]photographs
	I [A7sus4]absolutely love her
	When she [G5]smiles.[D Csus2 G5 D Csus2]{}
	
	\songsection{Verse 1}
	[Bm]How many days in a [Csus2]year
	She [G5]woke up with hope, but she [D]only found tears?
	And I can be so insincere
	Making her promises never for real
	As long as she stands there waiting
	Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
	How many days disappear?
	When you look in the mirror, so how do you choose?
	
	\songsection{Pre-Chorus}
	Your [Em7]clothes never wear as [Dadd4/F#]well the next day
	And your [G5]hair never falls in [A7sus4]quite the same way
	[Em7]You never seem to [Dadd4/F#]run out of things to [A7sus4]say
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{This is the story of a girl...}
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	Now how many lovers would stay
	Just to put up with this every day and all day?
	Now how did we wind up this way
	Watching our mouths for the words that we say?
	As long as we stand here waiting
	Wearing the clothes or the soles that we choose
	Now how do we get there today
	When we're walking too far for the price of our shoes?
	
	\songsection{Pre-Chorus} \songsnippet{Your clothes never wear as well the next day...}

	This is the story of a girl
	Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
	And while she looks so sad in photographs
	I absolutely love her
		
	This is the story of a girl
	A pretty face she hid from the world
	And while she looks so sad and lonely there
	I absolutely love her
	
	This is the story of a girl
	Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
	And while she looks so sad in photographs
	I absolutely love her
	When she [G5]smiles [D Csus2 G5]{}
	[D]When [Csus2|]{she} [G5]smiles [D Csus2 G5]{}

	\songsection{Verse 1}
	I've [G]been a wild rover for many's the [C]year
	I've [G]spent all me [C]money on [D7]whiskey and [G]beer
	But now I'm returning with gold in great store
	And I never will play the wild rover no more
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	And it's [D7]no, nay, never;[G] No, nay, never, no [C]more
	Will I [G]play the wild [C]rover. No, [D7]never, no [G]more.
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	I went into an ale-house I used to frequent
	I told the landlady me money was spent
	I asked her for credit, she answered me, "Nay
	Such a custom as yours I can have any day"
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{And it's no, nay, never; No, nay, never, no more...}
	
	\songsection{Verse 3}
	I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright
	And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
	She says, "I have whiskeys and wines of the best"
	And the words that she told me were only in jest
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{And it's no, nay, never; No, nay, never, no more...}
	
	\songsection{Verse 4}
	I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done
	And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
	And when they've caressed me as oft' times before
	Then I never will play the wild rover no more
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{And it's no, nay, never; No, nay, never, no more...} (x2)

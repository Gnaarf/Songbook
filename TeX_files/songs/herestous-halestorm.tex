	\songsection{Verse 1}
	[C]We could just go [F]home right now or [Am]maybe we could [G]stick around
	For [C]just one more [F]drink, oh [Am]yeah [G]{}
	[C]Get another [F]bottle out, let's [Am]shoot the shit, [G]sit back down
	For [C]just one more [F]drink, oh [Am]yeah [G]{}
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	Here's to [C]us, here's to [G]love, all the [Am]times that we fucked [F]up
	Here's to [C]you, fill the [G]glass 'cause the [Am]last few days have [F]kicked my ass
	So [C]let's give 'em [G]hell! Wish [Am]everybody w[F]ell.
	Here's to [C]us[G|], here's to [Am|]{us} [F]{}
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	We stuck it out this far together, put our dreams through the shredder
	Let's toast 'cause things got better
	As everything could change like that and all these years go by so fast but...
	Nothing lasts forever
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	Here's to us, here's to love, all the times that we messed up
	Here's to you, fill the glass 'cause the last few nights have kicked my ass
	If they give you hell, tell 'em go fuck themselves
	Here's to us, here's to us
	
	\songsection{Bridge}
	Here's to [D]all that we kissed and to [F]all that we missed
	To the [C]biggest mistakes that we [G]just wouldn't trade
	To [F]us breaking up without us breaking down
	To what[G]ever's coming our way
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	Here's to us, here's to love, all the times that we fucked up
	Here's to you, fill the glass 'cause the last few days have kicked my ass
	So let's give 'em hell! Wish everybody well.
	Here's to us, here's to love, all the times that we messed up
	Here's to you, fill the glass 'cause the last few nights have kicked my ass
	If they give you hell, tell 'em go fuck themselves (Go fuck themselves)
	Here's to us (here's to us), here's to us (here's to us)
	
	\songsection{Outro}
	Here's to [C]us, here's to [G]love, here's to [Am]us (Wish everybody [F]well)
	Here's to [C]us, here's to [G]love, here's to [Am]us [F]{}
	Here's to [C]us

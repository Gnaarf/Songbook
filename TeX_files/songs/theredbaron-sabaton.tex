	\songsection{Verse 1}
	[Bm]Man and machine and nothing there in between
	The flying [A]circus and a man from [Bm]Prussia
	The [Bm]sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
	The western [A]front and all the way to [Bm]Russia
	
	\songsection{Pre-chorus}
	[D] Death from a[A]bove, you're under [Bm]fire
	[D] Stained red as [A]blood, he’s roaming [Bm]higher
	[G] Born a [A]soldier from the [D]horseback [F#m]to the [Bm]skies
	[G] That's where the [A]legend will a[F#]rise
	[]And he's flying...
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	[Bm]Higher, the [A]king of the sky
	He’s [Bm]flying too fast and he's [A]flying too high
	[Bm]Higher, an [A]eye for an eye
	The [Bm]legend will never [A]die
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	First to the scene, he is a lethal machine
	It's bloody April and the tide is turning
	Fire at will, it is the thrill of the kill
	Four in a day, shot down with engines burning
	
	\songsection{Pre-chorus}
	Embrace the fame, red squadron leader
	Call out his name, Rote Kampfflieger
	In the game to win, a gambler rolls the dice
	80 allies paid the price
	And he's flying...

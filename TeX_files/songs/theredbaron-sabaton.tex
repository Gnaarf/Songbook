	\songsection{Verse 1}
	[Bm]Man and machine and nothing there in between,
	The flying [A]circus and a man from [Bm]Prussia.
	The [Bm]sky and a plane, this man commands his domain.
	The western [A]front and all the way to [Bm]Russia.
	
	\songsection{Pre-chorus}
	[D] Death from a[A]bove, you're under [Bm]fire.
	[D] Stained red as [A]blood, he’s roaming [Bm]higher.
	[G] Born a [A]soldier from the [D]horseback [F#m]to the [Bm]skies,
	[G] That's where the [A]legend will a[F#]rise. [\textit{N.C.}]And he's flying...
	
	\begin{highlightbar}
		\songsection{Chorus}
		[Bm]Higher, the [A]king of the sky. He’s [Bm]flying too fast and he's [A]flying too high.
		[Bm]Higher, an [A]eye for an eye. The [Bm]legend will never [A]die.
	\end{highlightbar}
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	First to the scene, he is a lethal machine.
	It's bloody April and the tide is turning.
	Fire at will, it is the thrill of the kill.
	Four in a day, shot down with engines burning.
	
	\songsection{Pre-chorus}
	Embrace the fame, red squadron leader.
	Call out his name, Rote Kampfflieger.
	In the game to win, a gambler rolls the dice.
	80 allies paid the price. And he's flying...

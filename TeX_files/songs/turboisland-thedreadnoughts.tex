	\songsection{Verse 1}
	'Twere [G]back in the year of [D]1986
	I [G]courted a maid from the [C]wild wild west
	She [G]took I to a place where [D]cider's always ace
	Re[G]turn to [C]Turbo [D]Is[G]land

		\songsection{Chorus}
		Who[G]oh$\sim$ We'll [D]raise the main sail
		Who[G]oh$\sim$ And we'll [C]battle the gale
		Who[G]oh$\sim$ We're [D]all going to hell
		As we re[G]turn to [C]Turbo [D]Is[G]land
	\end{highlightbar}
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	Our ship, oh she be, a-rockin' on the sea
	Our bosun be a-prayin' to the lord
	My babby makes a plea, oh won't you marry me
	As we return to Turbo Island

	\songsection{Verse 3}
	You won't find Turbo Island on any sort of a map
	They said if thee's left that place there's no way to go back
	We searched the Stoke's Croft Point, and off the old bear pit
	And now that we've found the place, we'll drink like lunatics

		... As we re[G]turn to [C]Turbo [D]Is[G]land
		As we re[G]turn to [C]Turbo [D]Is[G]land

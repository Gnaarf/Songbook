	\songsection{Verse 1}
	[C]Hop Master give us a [F]pint of [G]thy [C]best
	The [C]courage of our men will be [F]put to the [G]test
	Our [F]great revo[G]lution this [F]country will [G]save
	[C]We just need something to [F]help us [G]be [C]brave
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	[C]Whiskey and Beer will [F]conquer our [G]fear
	[C]Whiskey and Beer I [F]need it right [G]here
	To [C]start a revolution takes [F]courage and [G]spunk
	To [C]start a revolution it [F]helps to [G]be [C]drunk
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	We'll sing songs of bravery the best that you've heard
	Until we start slurring and forgetting the words
	When our bladders feel heavy but our heads feel light
	That's when we'll know that we're ready to fight
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{Whiskey and Beer will conquer our fear...}
	
	\songsection{Verse 3}
	We'll get less coherent as the evening wears on
	Through blurry-eyed vision we'll watch for the dawn
	We'll stumble into battle our hearts will be stout
	And we'll be victorious unless we pass out
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{Whiskey and Beer will conquer our fear...}
	
	\songsection{Verse 4}
	We'll pick up our weapons and aim for their chests
	With balance unsteady we'll hope for the best
	And if we should fail, our lives to defend
	In one last act of courage we'll vomit on them
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{Whiskey and Beer will conquer our fear...}
	
	\songsection{Verse 5}
	Hop Master give us a pint of thy best
	One minstrel's courage will be put to the test
	The pub is surrounded by dawn I'll be dead
	My plan is to drink till I can't feel my head
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{Whiskey and Beer will conquer our fear...} (x2)
	
	\songsection{Outro}
	To [C]start a revolution it [F]helps to [G]be [C]drunk [G C]{}

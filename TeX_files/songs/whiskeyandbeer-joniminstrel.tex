	\songsection{Verse 2}
	We'll sing songs of bravery the best that you've heard
	Until we start slurring and forgetting the words
	When our bladders feel heavy but our heads feel light
	That's when we'll know that we're ready to fight

	\songsection{Verse 3}
	We'll get less coherent as the evening wears on
	Through blurry-eyed vision we'll watch for the dawn
	We'll stumble into battle our hearts will be stout
	And we'll be victorious unless we pass out

	\songsection{Verse 4}
	We'll pick up our weapons and aim for their chests
	With balance unsteady we'll hope for the best
	And if we should fail, our lives to defend
	In one last act of courage we'll vomit on them

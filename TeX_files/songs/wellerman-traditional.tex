	\songsection{Verse 1}
	There [Am]once was a ship that put to sea
	And the [Dm]name of that ship was the [Am]Billy o' Tea
	The [Am]winds blew hard, her bow dipped down
	O [E]blow, me bully boys, [Am]blow (Huh!)
	
	\begin{highlightbar}
		\songsection{Chorus}
		[F]Soon may the [C]Wellerman come
		To [Dm]bring us sugar and [Am]tea and rum
		[F]One day, when the [C]tonguin' is done
		We'll [E]take our leave and [Am]go
	\end{highlightbar}
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	She had not been two weeks from shore
	When down on her a right whale bore
	The captain called all hands and swore
	He'd take that whale in tow (Huh!)

	\songsection{Verse 3}
	Before the boat had hit the water
	The whale's tail came up and caught her
	All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
	When she dived down below (Huh!)

		\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{Soon may the Wellerman come...}
	\end{highlightbar}
	
	\songsection{Verse 4}
	No line was cut, no whale was freed;
	The Captain's mind was not on greed
	But he belonged to the whaleman's creed;
	She took that ship in tow (Huh!)

	\songsection{Verse 5}
	For [Am]forty days, or even more
	The [Dm]line went slack, then [Am]tight once more
	All [Am]boats were lost, there were only four
	But [E]still that whale did [Am]go
	
	\begin{highlightbar}
		\songsection{Chorus}
		[F]Soon may the [C]Wellerman come
		To [Dm]bring us sugar and [Am]tea and rum
		[F]One day, when the [C]tonguin' is done
		We'll [E]take our leave and [Am]go
	\end{highlightbar}
	
	\songsection{Verse 6}
	As far as I've heard, the fight's still on;
	The line's not cut and the whale's not gone
	The Wellerman makes his a regular call
	To encourage the Captain, crew, and all

	\songsection{Verse 1}
	In [G]Dublin's fair [Em]city where the [Am]girls are so [D7]pretty,
	I [G]first set my [Em]eyes on sweet [Am]Molly Ma[D]lone.
	She [G]wheeled her wheel[Em]barrow through the [Am]streets broad and [D7]narrow
	Crying: "[G]Cockles and [Em]mussles, a[Am]live, a[D]live, [G]oh"
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	"A[G]live, alive, [Em]oh, a[Am]live, alive, [D7]oh"
	Crying: "[G]Cockles and [Em]mussles, a[Am]live, a[D]live, [G]oh"
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	She was a fishmonger and sure t'was no wonder
	For so were her father and mother before.
	They both wheeled their barrow through the streets broad and narrow
	Crying: "Cockles and mussles, alive, alive, oh."
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{"Alive, alive, oh, alive, alive, oh"...}
	
	\songsection{Verse 3}
	She died of a fever and no one to grieve her
	And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone.
	Now her ghost wheels her barrow through the streets broad and narrow
	Crying: "Cockles and mussles, alive, alive, oh."
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{"Alive, alive, oh, alive, alive, oh"...} (x2)

	\songsection{Verse 1}
	[D]Stunning 8K-resolution [G]meditation [D]app
	In [D]honor of the revolution, it's[G] half-off at the [D]Gap
	[Em]Deadpool's self-a[A]wareness, loving [Bm]parents, harmless [G]fun
	The [Em]backlash to the [A]backlash to the [Bm]thing that's just be[G]gun
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	[D]There it is ag[Em]ain, that funny feeling
	[Bm] That funny [G]feeling
	There it is again, that funny feeling
	That funny feeling
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	The surgeon general's pop-up shop, Robert Iger's face
	Discount Etsy agitprop, Bugles' take on race
	Female Colonel Sanders, easy answers, civil war
	The whole world at your fingertips, the ocean at your door
	
	The live-action Lion King, the Pepsi Halftime Show
	Twenty-thousand years of this; seven more to go
	Carpool Karaoke, Steve Aoki, Logan Paul
	A gift shop at the gun range, a mass shooting at the mall
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{There it is again, that funny feeling...}
	
	\songsection{Verse 3}
	Reading Pornhub's terms of service, going for a drive
	And obeying all the traffic laws in Grand Theft Auto V
	Full agoraphobic, losing focus, cover blown
	A book on getting better hand-delivered by a drone
	
	Total disassociation, fully out your mind
	Googling derealization, hating what you find
	That unapparent summer air in early fall
	The quiet comprehending of the ending of it all
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{There it is again, that funny feeling...}
	\pagebreak
	\songsection{Bridge (x5) {\footnotesize (with fade-out)}}
	[D]Hey, what can you say?
	We were [Em]overdue
	But it'll be [C]over soon
	You [G]wait (buh-duh-da, buh-duh-da, buh-duh-duh-duh-duh-da)

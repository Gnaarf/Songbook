	\songsection{Verse 1}
	Should [G]old acquaintance [D]be forgot, and [Em]never brought to [C]mind?
	Should [G]old acquaintance [D]be forgot, and [Em]auld [C]lang [G]syne?
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	For [G]auld lang [D]syne, my dear, for [G]auld lang [C]syne,
	we'll [G]take a cup of [D]kindness yet, for [Em]auld [C]lang [G]syne.
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	And surely you'll buy your pint cup! And surely I'll buy mine!
	And we'll take a cup o' kindness yet, for auld lang syne.
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{For auld lang syne, my dear, ...}
	
	\songsection{Verse 3}
	We two have run about the hills, and picked the daisies fine;
	But we've wandered many a weary foot, since auld lang syne.
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{For auld lang syne, my dear, ...}
	
	\songsection{Verse 4}
	We two have paddled in the stream, from morning sun till dine;
	But seas between us broad have roared since auld lang syne.
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{For auld lang syne, my dear, ...}
	
	\songsection{Verse 5}
	And there's a hand my trusty friend! And give me a hand o' thine!
	And we'll take a right good-will draught, for auld lang syne.
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{For auld lang syne, my dear, ...}

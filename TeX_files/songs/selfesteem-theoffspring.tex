	\songsection{Intro}
	[Am]Laalaa [F]lalalaa [C]laalaa [G]lalalaa!
	
	\songsection{Verse 1}
	[Am] I wrote her [F]off for the [C]tenth time toda[G]y
	(And) practiced all the things I would say
	(But) she came over, I lost my nerve
	I took her back and made her dessert
	I know I'm being used
	That's okay, man, 'cause I like the abuse
	I know she's playing with me
	That's okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	Oh [Am]hey ye[F]ah [C]yeah [G]yeeh-eah
	Oh yeah yeeaah
	Oh yeah yeeh-eah
	Oh yeah yeeaah
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	We make plans to go out at night
	I wait 'til two, then I turn out the light
	This rejection's got me so low
	(If) she keeps it up, I just might tell her so
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{Oh hey yeah yeah yeeh-eah...}
	
	\songsection{Bridge}
	[Dm] When she's [Bb]saying, [F]oh, that she [C]wants only me
	Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
	When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease
	Then I wonder how much more I can spend
	Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
	But I really think it's better this way
	[Dm] The more you [Bb]suffer[C] the more it [G]shows you really [F]care
	[F]Right? [G]Yeah, yeah, [Am]yeah
	\pagebreak
	\songsection{Verse 3}
	Now I'll relate this little bit
	Happens more than I'd like to admit
	Late at night, she knocks on my door
	She's drunk again and looking to score
	I know I should say no but
	It's kind of hard when she's ready to go
	I may be dumb, (but) I'm not a dweeb
	I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem

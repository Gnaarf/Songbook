	\songsection{Verse 1}
	I'm [D]crucifying Jesus, [G]banging in the [D]nails
	And I am so happy, be[A]cause old Jesus failed
	I'm [D]crucifying Jesus, [G]nail him to the [D]cross
	The poor old bastard bleeds to death and [A]I don't give a [D]toss
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	I'm [D]bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, [G]banging in the [D]nails
	I'm [D]bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, [A]banging in the [D]nails
	I'm [D]bang, bang, bang, bang, [G]banging in the [D]nails
	I'm [D]bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, [A]banging in the [D]nails
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	I'm crucifying Jesus, in my piss he bathes
	I think I am a pervert, I think I am depraved
	I'm crucifying Jesus, beat him to a pulp
	I stick my organ in his mouth and on it he must gulp
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	I'm bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, banging in the nails
	I'm bang, bang, bang, bang, banging in the nails
	I'm bang, bang, bang, bang, banging in the nails
	I'm bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, banging in the nails
	
	\songsection{Interlude}
	You see that crown of thorns upon his head?
	Well that was my idea
	I think I might be going to hell
	Oh dear!
	
	\songsection{Chorus (x3)}
	I'm bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, banging in the nails
	I'm bang, bang, bang, bang, banging in the nails
	I'm bang, bang, bang, bang, banging in the nails
	I'm bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, banging in the nails

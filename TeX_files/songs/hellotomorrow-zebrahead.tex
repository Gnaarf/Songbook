	[G#m] Hello to[E]morrow and good[B]bye to yester[F#]day.
	We've been [G#m]waiting for this [E]moment and we [B]still don't know what to [F#]say.
	We may [G#m]never find the [E]answers or [B]know the reason [F#]why,
	Why we [G#m]both decided [E]we should say goodbye

	\songsection{Verse 1}
	[G#m]Nothing but good things are coming my way
	If [E]you are going, please let me stay
	[C#m]You bring me down when I'm getting high
	[F#]You turn me on, I amplify
	[G#m]1-2-3, times you've [E]broken me (broken me)
	[C#m]1-2-3 (three) [E]1-2-[F#]3
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	I won't bleed like this forever
	I'm down to ride but my wings are severed
	Blindside blitz- evacuation
	I'm stuck in hell, you're on vacation
	1-2-3, times you've broken me (broken me)
	1-2-3 (three) 1-2-3

		I've been [G#m_]{wai}[E]ting, [B]waiting for the [F#]day
		I've been [G#m_]{wai}[E]ting, [B]waiting for the [F#]day
		I'm still [G#m]waiting for to[E]morrow, tired of [B]living in yester[F#]day
		I've been [G#m_]{wai}[E]ting, [B]waiting for the [F#]day I'd be over [G#m]you

	\songsection{Verse 3}
	[G#m]Oceans, devotions, these notions run dry
	[E]Floating away and I don't know why
	[C#m]Spend all my days in a bottle thinking
	[F#]You're like an anchor - got me sinking
	[G#m]1-2-3, times you've [E]broken me (broken me)
	[C#m]1-2-3 (three) [E]1-2-[F#]3
	
	\songsection{Verse 4}
	Say goodbye now and mean it forever
	Got to move on and keep it together
	Forget the things that you've said and you've done
	That's in the past, here comes the sun
	1-2-3 times you've broken me (broken me)
	1-2-3 (three) 1-2-3

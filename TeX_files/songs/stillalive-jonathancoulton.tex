	\songsection{Verse 1}
	This was a tri[D]umph.[Bm]{}
	[D] I'm [Bm]making a [D]note here: [Bm]huge suc[D]cess.[Bm]{}
	It's [Em]hard to over[A]state my satis[D]faction.[Bm]{}
	[D] [Bm]Aperture Sci[D]ence[Bm]{}
	[D] We [Bm]do what we [D]must be[Bm]cause we [D]can.[Bm]{}
	[Em]For the good of [A]all of us, except the [Bb]ones who are dead.
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	But there's [F]no sense [C]crying over [Bb]every mis[F]take.
	You just [F]keep on [C]trying till you [Bb]run out of [F]cake.
	And the [Gm]science gets [C]done and you [F]make a neat [Dm]gun
	for the [Bb]people who [A]are still [D]alive.[Bm ] [D ] [Bm ] [D ] [Bm ] [D ] [Bm]{}
	
	\songsection{Verse 2}
	I'm not even angry.
	I'm being so sincere right now.
	Even though you broke my heart and killed me.
	And tore me to pieces.
	And threw every piece into a fire.
	As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	Now these points of data make a beautiful line
	And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time.
	So I'm glad I got burned, think of all the things we learned
	For the people who are still alive.
	
	\songsection{Verse 3}
	Go ahead and leave me.
	I think I prefer to stay inside.
	Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.
	Maybe Black Mesa.
	That was a joke, ha ha, fat chance.
	Anyway this cake is great; it's so delicious and moist.
	
	\songsection{Chorus}
	Look at me still talking when there's science to do.
	When I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you.
	I've experiments to run, there is research to be done
	On the people who are still alive.
	
	\songsection{Outro}
	And be[D]lieve me I [Bm]am still a[D]live.[Bm]{}	
	I'm doing science and I'm still alive.
	I feel fantastic and I'm still alive.
	While you're dying I'll be still alive.
	And when you're dead I will be still alive.
	Still alive. Still alive.

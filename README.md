# Songbook

First thing, [here's the pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gnaarf/Songbook/master/Songbook.pdf)

Apart from that, technical stuff:

- compiling requires a specific build chain. I use TeXStudio's "DVI->PDF Chain". 
The reason is that [MusicTEX](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/musictex) (which I use for the fancy tabs) has some kind of three pass system, and that system in turn requires some more complicated build chain.

- compiling may take some minutes (at least on my PC)
